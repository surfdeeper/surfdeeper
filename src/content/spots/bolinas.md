## Overview
Bolinas is a scenic beach break in Marin County, known for its powerful waves and laid-back surf culture. The spot offers consistent surf and a more mellow vibe compared to crowded Bay Area breaks, though locals are protective of their break.

## Wave Characteristics
- **Type**: Beach break with shifting sandbars
- **Best Size**: 3-6 feet
- **Direction**: Works best on NW-W swells
- **Bottom**: Sandy with occasional cobblestones

## Conditions
- **Best Tide**: Mid to high tide (low tide can be shallow)
- **Best Wind**: Light offshore (E/NE) or calm
- **Season**: Year-round, best in fall through spring

## Local Knowledge
### The Reality Check
- **Locals Only Vibe**: Bolinas has a reputation for being protective of their spot
- **Powerful Waves**: Heavier than it looks, with strong currents
- **Inconsistent Sandbars**: The peak shifts with storms and tides
- **Remote Feel**: Less crowded than SF spots but still gets busy on good days

### Best Times
- **Early Morning**: Dawn sessions before the wind picks up
- **Weekdays**: Much less crowded than weekends
- **After Storms**: Can have great shape when sandbars reform

## Hazards
- **Rip Currents**: Strong rips, especially near the lagoon
- **Localism**: Respect the locals and don't be aggressive
- **Cold Water**: Often colder than SF due to upwelling
- **Changing Conditions**: Sandbars shift frequently

## Access
- **Parking**: Limited street parking near Wharf Road
- **Cost**: Free parking
- **Facilities**: Minimal - small town with a few shops
- **Getting There**: Drive through Stinson Beach, or take the back route via Olema

## Local Tips
- **Show Respect**: Don't be aggressive in the lineup
- **Know the Community**: Bolinas is a small, tight-knit surf town
- **Check Multiple Peaks**: Walk the beach to find the best sandbar
- **Bring Everything**: Limited facilities, bring food and water

## Skill Level
- **Beginner**: ⚠️ Not recommended - powerful waves and strong currents
- **Intermediate**: Good spot to progress in clean conditions
- **Advanced**: Great for when you want solid, less-crowded surf

## Best Alternatives
If Bolinas isn't working:
- **Stinson Beach** (more mellow, better for beginners)
- **Dillon Beach** (north, more exposed)
- **Point Reyes beaches** (various breaks to the north)
