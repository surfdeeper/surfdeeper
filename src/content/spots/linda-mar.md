## Overview
Linda Mar is one of the most popular surf spots in the San Francisco Bay Area, known for its accessibility and consistent waves. However, it's also notorious for its challenging conditions and crowded lineup.

## Wave Characteristics
- **Type**: Beach break with sandbars
- **Best Size**: 2-4 feet (head high)
- **Direction**: Works best on NW swells
- **Bottom**: Sandy with occasional rocks

## Conditions
- **Best Tide**: Mid to high tide
- **Best Wind**: Light offshore (E/NE)
- **Season**: Year-round, best in fall/winter

## Local Knowledge
### The Reality Check
- **Steep Closeouts**: Linda Mar is famous for its steep, fast-breaking waves that often close out
- **Crowded Weekends**: Expect 50+ people in the water on weekends, especially beginners
- **Surfline Lies**: The forecast often shows 1-2 feet when it's actually 4-5+ feet
- **Beginner Trap**: Looks mellow from the beach but can be surprisingly powerful

### Best Times
- **Weekday Mornings**: Less crowded, better wave selection
- **Dawn Patrol**: 6-8 AM for the best conditions
- **Avoid**: Weekends, holidays, and summer afternoons

## Hazards
- **Rocks**: Scattered rocks near the north end
- **Rip Currents**: Strong rips, especially at low tide
- **Crowds**: Beginner surfers with poor etiquette
- **Closeouts**: Waves break fast and hard

## Access
- **Parking**: Large parking lot at the south end (often full on weekends)
- **Cost**: $3-5 parking fee
- **Facilities**: Restrooms, showers, surf shop nearby

## Local Tips
- **Paddle Out**: Go north of the main crowd for cleaner waves
- **Timing**: Watch the sets for 10-15 minutes before paddling out
- **Etiquette**: Be patient with beginners but don't let them snake you
- **Gear**: Bring a longer board for the steep drops

## Skill Level
- **Beginner**: ⚠️ Not recommended - looks easier than it is
- **Intermediate**: Good for learning in smaller conditions
- **Advanced**: Can be fun when it's working properly

## Best Alternatives
If Linda Mar is too crowded or closing out:
- **Rockaway Beach** (just north)
- **Montara** (south, more advanced)
- **Pacifica State Beach** (south end)
