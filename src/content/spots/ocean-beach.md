## Overview
Ocean Beach is San Francisco's premier surf spot, stretching for miles along the western edge of the city. Known for powerful, hollow waves and challenging conditions, OB (as locals call it) is not for the faint of heart. This is one of the most dangerous surf spots in California.

## Wave Characteristics
- **Type**: Beach break with heavy, powerful waves
- **Best Size**: 4-8 feet (can handle much larger)
- **Direction**: Best on W-NW swells
- **Bottom**: Sandy with shifting sandbars

## Conditions
- **Best Tide**: Mid tide (low tide can be deadly, high tide often closes out)
- **Best Wind**: Light offshore (E) or calm mornings
- **Season**: Year-round, most consistent in fall/winter

## Local Knowledge
### The Reality Check
- **Extremely Dangerous**: People die here every year
- **Heavy Paddle Out**: Long, punishing paddle through strong currents
- **Shifting Peaks**: Sandbars change constantly, making it hard to position
- **Cold and Sharky**: Great white sharks frequent the area
- **Expert Spot Only**: This is not a place to learn or push your limits

### Best Times
- **Dawn Patrol**: Early morning before wind picks up (usually onshore by 11 AM)
- **Weekdays**: Still crowded but more manageable
- **Noriega to Sloat**: Generally the best stretch for consistent peaks

## Hazards
- **Drowning Risk**: Strong rip currents and unpredictable sets
- **Sharks**: Great whites are present, especially near seal colonies
- **Cold Water**: 50-55°F year-round, hypothermia risk
- **Heavy Closeouts**: Waves can hold you down for multiple waves
- **Isolation**: Long beach, help is far away if something goes wrong
- **Pollution**: Water quality issues after rain

## Access
- **Parking**: Multiple parking areas along Great Highway
- **Cost**: Free street parking
- **Facilities**: Limited - some spots have restrooms
- **Multiple Peaks**: Check different sections (Noriega, Judah, Sloat, etc.)

## Local Tips
- **Respect Your Limits**: If it looks big from the beach, it's huge
- **Watch First**: Observe for 15-30 minutes before paddling out
- **Paddle North**: Use the rip to get out, paddle north, then come in on the peak
- **Never Surf Alone**: Buddy system is essential
- **Know the Channels**: Learn where the rip currents are and use them
- **Check Buoy Data**: Surfline often underestimates OB size

## Skill Level
- **Beginner**: ❌ Absolutely not - life-threatening
- **Intermediate**: ❌ Still too dangerous
- **Advanced**: ⚠️ Only if you're comfortable in heavy, powerful surf with strong currents

## Best Alternatives
If Ocean Beach is too big or dangerous:
- **Fort Point** (protected, wind swell)
- **Kelly's Cove** (more protected at south end of OB)
- **Pacifica** (Linda Mar, Rockaway)
- **Half Moon Bay** (various spots)

## Emergency Information
- **Lifeguards**: Limited coverage, mainly in summer
- **Emergency**: Call 911 immediately if someone is in trouble
- **Nearest Hospital**: UCSF Medical Center
