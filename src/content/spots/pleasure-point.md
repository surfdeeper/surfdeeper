## Overview
Pleasure Point is one of Santa Cruz's most iconic surf spots, featuring multiple reef and point breaks along a scenic stretch of coast. With various peaks offering different wave types and skill levels, Pleasure Point is a staple of Santa Cruz surf culture and can produce world-class waves.

## Wave Characteristics
- **Type**: Reef/point break with multiple peaks
- **Best Size**: 3-8 feet (some peaks handle bigger)
- **Direction**: Best on W-SW swells
- **Bottom**: Rocky reef with some sand

## Conditions
- **Best Tide**: Varies by peak (generally mid tide)
- **Best Wind**: Light offshore (N/NE) or morning glass
- **Season**: Year-round, best in fall through spring

## Local Knowledge
### The Peaks (South to North)
1. **Sewer Peak**: Most consistent, handles bigger swells, advanced
2. **First Peak**: Long rights, gets very crowded, intermediate to advanced
3. **Second Peak**: Shorter but fun, intermediate
4. **The Point** (Privates): Longer rides on bigger swells, advanced

### The Reality Check
- **Competitive Lineup**: Excellent surfers, high skill level required
- **Crowded**: One of the most crowded spots in Santa Cruz
- **Drop-In Central**: Aggressive lineup, know the rules
- **Rocks Everywhere**: Shallow reef, sharp rocks, booties recommended
- **Locals Know Best**: They know the reef, peaks, and positioning

### Best Times
- **Early Morning**: Glass off before the wind and crowds
- **Weekdays**: Less packed but still busy
- **After Big Swells**: When smaller swells clean up the peaks

## Hazards
- **Shallow Reef**: Sharp rocks and urchins
- **Crowds**: Heavy competition for waves
- **Aggressive Locals**: Respect the pecking order
- **Rocks on Entry/Exit**: Tricky to get in and out
- **Sea Life**: Seals, occasional sharks

## Access
- **Parking**: Very limited street parking along East Cliff Drive
- **Cost**: Free parking (if you can find it)
- **Facilities**: Minimal - neighborhood spot with nearby shops
- **Walk Required**: May need to park several blocks away and walk

## Local Tips
- **Show Respect**: Wait your turn, don't paddle inside
- **Know Your Peak**: Each peak has different rules and skill levels
- **Booties Recommended**: Protect your feet from rocks and urchins
- **Watch First**: Study the lineup dynamics before paddling out
- **Be Prepared**: Bring a leash, the rocks are unforgiving
- **Alternate Spots**: If it's too crowded, try nearby spots

## Skill Level
- **Beginner**: ❌ Too crowded, rocky, and advanced
- **Intermediate**: ⚠️ Possible at Second Peak in smaller conditions if you know reef breaks
- **Advanced**: Ideal spot for experienced surfers

## Best Alternatives
If Pleasure Point is too crowded or not working:
- **The Hook** (just south, more mellow)
- **38th Avenue** (nearby, various peaks)
- **Capitola** (less crowded, good for intermediates)
- **Steamer Lane** (more advanced, equally crowded)

## Parking Tips
- **Be Patient**: Parking is extremely limited
- **Respect Residents**: Don't block driveways
- **Consider Biking**: Many locals bike to avoid parking hassles
- **Early Bird**: Arrive very early to secure parking
