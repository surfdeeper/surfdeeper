# Swimming Fundamentals for Surfers

Strong surf paddling comes from precise body control in the water: a long body line, front‑quadrant timing, a quiet two‑beat kick, and managing effort so you don’t redline between sets. For more perspectives, explore methods like [Total Immersion](https://www.totalimmersion.net) and [Swim Smooth](https://www.swimsmooth.com) — this guide stays neutral and focuses on transferable fundamentals.



## Core Focus for Surfers
### 1) Front‑Quadrant Timing
Keep the lead arm extended until the catch starts on the other side to minimize dead spots. On the board, this feels like steady, overlapping strokes rather than pausing with both arms by your sides.

### 2) Two‑Beat Kick
Use a light kick that syncs one kick to each arm catch. It’s for balance and rhythm more than propulsion — quiet ankles, small amplitude, consistent timing.

### 3) Streamline and Balance
Lengthen through the crown of the head; keep the spine long and the hips high. On a surfboard, lightly lift the sternum instead of pressing the nose down to reduce drag.

### 4) Relaxed Power, High‑Elbow Catch
Set the forearm vertical early and press water back, not down. Keep the recovery quiet, shoulders relaxed, and let rotation help you connect core to catch.

### 5) RPE Management (Rate of Perceived Exertion)
Cruise most of the time at RPE 3–5 so you can spike to 7–8 only when chasing and popping up. Downshift between efforts with long exhales and smooth strokes.

## Simple Drills You Can Use Today
- Superman Glide: push off lightly with one arm forward; feel head–spine–hips align. On the board, keep the head neutral and hips high
- Back‑Float Streamline: float on your back, reach long through the fingertips, let the head lean back to align ears with water, ribs heavy — learn effortless buoyancy
- Side‑Balance Kick: side kick with a light flutter; breathe by rolling the whole body, not craning the neck
- Spearing Entry: enter fingers first, wrist–elbow following a narrow slot; quiet entries conserve momentum
- High‑Elbow Catch: set the forearm vertical early and press water back; on a board, make deeper, anchored pulls that move you forward

## Why It Matters for Surfers
- Lower heart rate while paddling; save sprints for takeoffs
- Less shoulder fatigue from cleaner mechanics and reduced drag
- Better timing and positioning due to calmer breath and clearer rhythm
- Improved decision‑making when sets arrive — less panic, more presence

## Next Steps
- Practice one drill per session; keep it easy and curious
- Film a 10–15 second clip of your paddle to observe drag and rhythm
- Prioritize form over speed; if it feels strained, slow down
- Swim mostly at RPE 3–4; add 2–3 short surges at RPE 7–8 each session
