# Swimming for Surfers: The Real Secret Sauce

## Why Swimming Matters

- Safety in wipeouts and currents
- Stamina for long paddles

## Total Immersion (Terry Laughlin)

- Relaxation over struggle
- Balance and streamline
- Efficient, long strokes
- See: [Total Immersion](/guide/preface/total-immersion)

## Swim Smooth Insights

- Stroke mechanics
- Breathing techniques
- Drills for efficiency

## Early Vertical Forearm (EVF)

- Set forearm vertical early; elbow high
- Hand path: shallow entry, fingertips down; stack forearm to a paddle
- Why it matters: propulsion at low effort â†’ lower heart rate
- Practice: sculling, doggy-paddle EVF, fist-swim; short quality reps
- Common mistakes: overreaching, pressing down, slipping the catch

## Translation to Surfing

- Lower heart rate = longer breath-holds
- Efficient paddling mechanics from swim drills
- Staying calm under stress

## Training Tips

- Pool sets for surfers
- Ocean swims
- Breath-hold training (with safety)

## Metrics That Matter (for Surfers)

- Balance stroke rate vs stroke length; find personal efficiency zone
- SWOLF is often misleading for surfers; prioritize sustainable pacing
- Practical metrics: RPE, breath cadence, repeatable pace, calm nasal-breathing
