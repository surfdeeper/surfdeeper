# Swimming Metrics for Surfers

## Useful Metrics
- RPE (Rate of Perceived Exertion) and breath cadence
- Repeatable pace over short repeats at easy effort
- Heart rate trends (lower HR for the same pace over time)
- Consistency: even pacing and relaxed form

## Contextual Metrics
- Stroke rate (cadence): spikes for sprints, moderate for cruising
- Stroke length: helps economy but not at cost of a slipping catch
- EVF quality (qualitative): clean catches per length

## Misleading or Overrated
- SWOLF: pool-focused; boards and ocean conditions change the game
- Absolute pace: wetsuits, chop, currents skew comparisons
- Counting strokes alone: ignores catch quality and body position

## What to Track in Practice
- Easy aerobic swims with nasal breathing and calm exhale
- Short technique sets prioritizing EVF and relaxed shoulders
- Occasional cadence-focused sprints maintaining a clean catch
- Calm under stress and post-set recovery time
