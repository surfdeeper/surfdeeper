# Stroke Rate vs Stroke Length

## Definitions
- Stroke Rate: cadence (strokes per minute)
- Stroke Length: distance covered per stroke
- Tradeoff: higher rate often reduces length, and vice versa

## Why Surfers Need Balance
- Goal: sustainable propulsion at low heart rate
- Cadence spikes for sprints; length focus for cruising economy
- Conditions vary: currents, chop, board buoyancy, wetsuits

## How to Find Your Zone
- Short repeats testing different cadences at easy effort
- Note breath cadence and RPE, not just speed
- Keep EVF quality; avoid catch slippage as cadence rises

## Practical Surf Translation
- Default: relaxed, long strokes; sprint: quick, compact cadence
- Match cadence to wave timing, not arbitrary numbers
- Quality over quantity: clean catches beat thrashy turnover
