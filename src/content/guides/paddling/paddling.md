# The Art of Efficient Paddling

## Why Paddling Matters
You’ll spend most of your session paddling. Efficient technique saves energy, protects shoulders, and helps you catch more waves.

## The Science of the Stroke
- Think lever and hydrofoil: hand/forearm generate lift, not just drag
- Maintain a high elbow (EVF) throughout the catch
- Enter hand at ~45°; set the catch then press water back

## Finding Your Sweet Spot (Body Position)
- Chest just behind board center; chin up, eyes forward
- Quiet, streamlined body; legs together and relaxed
- Let the board plane; avoid pressing the nose down

## The Breathing Connection
- Match breath to stroke rhythm to stay relaxed and powerful
- Breathe in at hand entry; breathe out during pull
- Aim for a sustainable rhythm you could hold for 20 minutes

## Mastering the Duck Dive
- Start early; push the nose down and the tail with knee
- Get the whole board under the wave; body follows board
- Start motion 10–15 feet before the wave reaches you

## Reading the Ocean
- Use rips to your advantage when paddling out
- Position intelligently to minimize wasted paddling
- Move less, catch more — strategy is free speed

## What Most Surfers Get Wrong
- Treating paddling like swimming; different mechanics and goals
- Paddling too hard too often; seek relaxed, sustainable rhythm
- Ignoring legs for balance and control

## How to Practice
- Short, focused sets: stroke mechanics, then breathing, etc.
- Film short clips to compare feel vs. reality
- Set clear goals for each paddling session

## Equipment that Helps
- Board choice balances stability and glide for your conditions
- Wetsuit fit affects shoulder freedom and drag

## Keeping Your Shoulders Healthy
- Rotate torso with each stroke to distribute load
- Stop if painful; don’t push through shoulder pain

## The Complete Picture
Efficient paddling blends mechanics, strategy, and mindset. The goal isn’t to paddle harder — it’s to paddle smarter.
