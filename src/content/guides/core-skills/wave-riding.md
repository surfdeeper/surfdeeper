# Wave Riding

## The Philosophy of Wave Riding

Wave riding isn’t a checklist of maneuvers. It’s a relationship with the wave — sensing energy, reading sections, and flowing with rhythm.

## Reading the Wave

- Learn the language of patterns; predict what’s next
- Seek the steepest sections — that’s where power lives
- Scan side‑to‑side, not just ahead; the best section might be less obvious
- Texture tells a story: glassy, organized = steep; choppy = flat
- Feel acceleration in the pocket; flat lifeless feel means you’re ahead

## Staying in the Pocket

- The pocket is the steep, powerful part of the wave
- Manage position actively; it’s always moving
- When you're too far ahead, cue a [cutback](/guide/core-skills/cutbacks) before you reach the flats

## Cutbacks: Pocket Management

- Start while you still have energy
- Look back at the breaking section; the board follows your eyes
- After the cutback, immediately hunt the next steep section

## Feeling the Wave

- Read feedback through the board: acceleration vs. flatness
- Centered weight to respond quickly to changes
- Don’t just look — feel. Let sensation guide timing and pressure

## What Most Surfers Get Wrong

- Treating wave riding as rigid maneuvers instead of flow
- Looking too far ahead and missing the present section
- Fighting the wave instead of redirecting with it

## Developing Your Reading

- Start small; refine pocket awareness without heavy consequences
- Drill cutbacks until automatic — they’re survival, not just style
- Watch others for timing and positioning cues

## Pro Tips

- Feel, don’t overthink
- Stay active in positioning
- Let sound and feel indicate pocket vs. flats
- Cut back early; read side‑to‑side

_Wave riding is about connection, not control._
