# Avoiding Pearling

## Why Pearling Happens
Pearling is when your board’s nose dives under water. It’s usually caused by being too far forward, too slow, or taking off too late so the wave grabs the nose before the tail.

## The Scoot Back Technique
Scooting back moves weight off the nose to prevent pearling.

### How to Scoot Back
1. Keep paddling with your arms
2. Use legs to push yourself back on the board
3. Shift weight toward the tail
4. Maintain rhythm

### Downsides
- You lose speed and momentum
- You lose angle down the line
- It’s reactive — fixing instead of preventing
- Often fights the wave’s energy

## Better Alternatives
### 1) Get More Speed
- Start paddling earlier and with more powerful strokes
- Paddle with the wave’s energy; build momentum early

### 2) Take Off at an Angle
- Look down the line before you paddle
- Angle as the wave lifts you; use rails to control

### 3) Use the Cobra Pose
- Arch the back and lift chest to shift weight back without losing position
- Keep paddling, legs extended, and forward momentum

### 4) Hand Positioning for Angling
- Steer the nose using push/pull hand pressure
- Left turn: pull left, push right rail; right turn: pull right, push left rail
- Start angling as soon as you feel lift

## Hold Onto Your Board
Holding on during wipeouts is the safest choice in most cases.

### Why Hold On
- Flotation to breathe and recover
- Avoid the underwater “spin cycle”
- Protect others from a loose board
- Faster recovery

### When to Let Go (Rare)
- Big waves with no one inside
- Safety hazards to others
- Medical emergencies

## Practice Tips
- Practice cobra pose on land
- Build paddling speed and power
- Practice angled takeoffs on small waves
- Consciously hold onto your board when you fall
