      <h2>Why Pearling Happens</h2>
      <p>Pearlingâ€”when your board's nose dives under the waterâ€”is one of the most frustrating experiences in surfing. You're perfectly positioned, the wave looks perfect, and suddenly you're underwater instead of riding. Understanding why it happens is the first step to preventing it.</p>
      
      <p>Pearling occurs when your board's nose gets caught by the wave's energy before the tail does. This happens when you're too far forward on the board, going too slow, or taking off too late. The wave's steep face catches your nose and pulls it down, while your tail is still on the flatter part of the wave.</p>

      <h2>The Scoot Back Technique</h2>
      <p>When you feel the wave starting to catch your nose, the most common advice is to scoot back on your board. This moves your weight away from the nose, preventing it from diving under the wave.</p>
      
      <div class="technique-steps">
        <div class="step">
          <h3>How to Scoot Back</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Keep paddling with your arms</li>
            <li>Use your legs to push yourself back on the board</li>
            <li>Shift your weight toward the tail</li>
            <li>Maintain your paddling rhythm</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="downsides">
        <h3>Why Scooting Back Isn't Always the Answer</h3>
        <p>While scooting back can save you from pearling, it has significant downsides:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>You lose speed:</strong> Moving back reduces your forward momentum, making it harder to catch the wave</li>
          <li><strong>You lose angle:</strong> Being further back makes it harder to angle down the line</li>
          <li><strong>You're fighting the wave:</strong> Instead of working with the wave's energy, you're working against it</li>
          <li><strong>It's reactive:</strong> You're fixing a problem instead of preventing it</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section class="better-alternatives">
      <h2>Better Alternatives to Scooting Back</h2>
      
      <div class="alternative">
        <h3>1. Get More Speed</h3>
        <p>The best way to avoid pearling is to never be in a position where it can happen. More speed means you're already moving with the wave's energy, not fighting it.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Start paddling earlier</li>
          <li>Use more powerful strokes</li>
          <li>Paddle with the wave's energy, not against it</li>
          <li>Build momentum before the wave reaches you</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="alternative">
        <h3>2. Take Off at an Angle</h3>
        <p>Instead of going straight toward the beach, angle your takeoff. This reduces the steepness of the wave face you're dealing with.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Look down the line before you paddle</li>
          <li>Start angling as soon as you feel the wave lift you</li>
          <li>Use your rails to control the angle</li>
          <li>Think "down the line" not "toward the beach"</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="alternative">
        <h3>3. The Cobra Pose</h3>
        <p>When you feel the wave starting to catch your nose, arch your back and lift your chestâ€”like a cobra. This shifts your weight back without losing your forward position on the board.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Keep your arms paddling</li>
          <li>Arch your back and lift your chest</li>
          <li>Keep your legs extended</li>
          <li>Maintain your forward momentum</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="alternative">
        <h3>4. Hand Positioning for Angling</h3>
        <p>Use your hands to control the board's nose and <a href="/techniques/angling-down-the-line">angle down the line</a>. This technique works especially well on longboards where you have more control over the board's direction. For longboards, the <a href="/techniques/cobra-pose">cobra pose</a> is particularly effective for preventing pearling while maintaining control.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Left turn:</strong> Pull left with your left hand, push down on the right rail with your right hand</li>
          <li><strong>Right turn:</strong> Pull right with your right hand, push down on the left rail with your left hand</li>
          <li>Keep paddling while using your hands to steer</li>
          <li>Start angling as soon as you feel the wave lift you</li>
        </ul>

    <section class="board-safety">
      <h2>Hold Onto Your Board</h2>
      <p>When you do wipe outâ€”and you willâ€”hold onto your board. This is crucial for your safety and the safety of others around you.</p>
      
      <div class="safety-reasons">
        <h3>Why You Should Hold On</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Your board is your flotation device:</strong> It keeps you above water where you can breathe</li>
          <li><strong>Prevents the spin cycle:</strong> Without your board, you'll tumble underwater with no reference point</li>
          <li><strong>Protects others:</strong> A loose board becomes a dangerous projectile</li>
          <li><strong>Faster recovery:</strong> You can get back on your board and paddle to safety</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="watch-others">
        <h3>Watch Other People Wipe Out</h3>
        <p>Next time you're in the lineup, watch what happens when people wipe out. Their boards fly into the airâ€”exactly where the person wants to be to breathe. Yet most surfers let go of their boards, sending them tumbling underwater instead of staying with their flotation device.</p>
        
        <p>Your board wants to go to the surface. You want to go to the surface. Why fight against each other?</p>
      </div>

      <div class="when-to-let-go">
        <h3>When to Let Go (Rarely)</h3>
        <p>Only let go of your board in these specific situations:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Big waves with no one inside:</strong> When the wave is powerful enough to pull you and your board apart</li>
          <li><strong>Safety hazard:</strong> When holding on would put others at risk</li>
          <li><strong>Medical emergency:</strong> When you need immediate help</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In 95% of wipeouts, holding onto your board is the safest option for everyone.</p>

    <section class="practice-tips">
      <h2>Practice Tips</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Practice the cobra pose on land first</li>
        <li>Work on your paddling speed and power</li>
        <li>Practice angled takeoffs on smaller waves</li>
        <li>When you do wipe out, consciously hold onto your board</li>
        <li>Watch experienced surfers and see how they handle close calls</li>
