  <section class="cobra-philosophy">
    <h2>Why the Cobra Pose Matters</h2>
    <p>The cobra pose isn't just a stance—it's a fundamental control technique for longboards. Unlike shorter boards that respond quickly to weight shifts, longboards require more precise weight distribution to prevent pearling while maintaining speed and control.</p>
    
    <p>Think of the cobra pose as your fine-tuning mechanism. When you're riding a longboard, everything happens more slowly, giving you more time to make adjustments but also more opportunities for things to go wrong. The cobra pose gives you the control you need to navigate these challenges.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="longboard-challenges">
    <h2>Why Longboards Need Special Techniques</h2>
    <p>Longboards present unique challenges that shorter boards don't face. Their length makes them more stable but also more prone to pearling. The extra volume means they respond differently to weight shifts, requiring more deliberate and controlled movements.</p>
    
    <div class="challenges-grid">

        <h3>Pearling Risk</h3>
        <p>Longboards are more prone to <a href="/techniques/avoid-pearling">nose-diving</a>, especially when taking off or making sharp turns. The cobra pose helps distribute weight more evenly.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="challenge-card">
        <h3>Slower Response</h3>
        <p>Everything happens more slowly on a longboard, giving you more time to adjust but also more opportunities for mistakes.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="challenge-card">
        <h3>Weight Distribution</h3>
        <p>Longboards require more precise weight distribution to maintain speed and control, especially when angling or turning.</p>

  <section class="entering-cobra-pose">
    <h2>Entering the Cobra Pose</h2>
    <p>The cobra pose is all about getting low and staying centered. It's not just about bending your knees—it's about creating a stable, responsive platform for control.</p>
    
    <div class="technique-steps">
      <div class="step-card">
        <h3>1. The Setup</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>As you drop into the wave, start getting low</li>
          <li>Bend your knees deeply, almost like you're about to jump</li>
          <li>Keep your chest up and your core engaged</li>
          <li>Your arms should be ready to grab the rails</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      
      <div class="step-card">
        <h3>2. The Low Stance</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Get as low as you comfortably can</li>
          <li>Your knees should be bent at least 90 degrees</li>
          <li>Keep your weight centered over the board</li>
          <li>This low stance helps prevent pearling by keeping weight centered</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      
      <div class="step-card">
        <h3>3. Ready Position</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Your hands should be ready to grab the rails</li>
          <li>Keep your shoulders square to the wave</li>
          <li>Look down the line where you want to go</li>
          <li>Stay balanced and ready to respond to the wave's changes</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>
  </section>

  <section class="rail-control">
    <h2>Rail Control in the Cobra Pose</h2>
    <p>Rail grabbing is crucial in the cobra pose. It gives you direct control over your board's direction and helps you maintain balance while making precise adjustments.</p>
    
    <div class="rail-techniques">
      <div class="technique-card">
        <h3>Front-Side Rail Grab</h3>
        <p>When riding front-side (facing the wave), grab the rail closest to the wave face. This gives you maximum control for bottom turns and maintaining your angle.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="technique-card">
        <h3>Back-Side Rail Grab</h3>
        <p>When riding back-side (back to the wave), grab the rail away from the wave. This helps maintain balance and control during back-side maneuvers.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="technique-card">
        <h3>Dual Rail Control</h3>
        <p>For maximum control, use both hands on the rails. This is especially effective for sharp direction changes and maintaining balance in critical sections.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </section>

  <section class="pressure-application">
    <h2>Applying Pressure in the Cobra Pose</h2>
    <p>The cobra pose gives you the leverage to apply precise pressure to different parts of your board. This is essential for controlling speed, direction, and preventing pearling.</p>
    
    <div class="pressure-techniques">
      <div class="technique-card">
        <h3>Nose Control</h3>
        <p>Use your front hand to control the nose direction. Apply pressure to the rail to steer the board where you want to go.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="technique-card">
        <h3>Speed Control</h3>
        <p>Use your back hand to control speed and prevent pearling. Apply pressure to the tail to slow down or maintain control.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="technique-card">
        <h3>Balance Maintenance</h3>
        <p>Use both hands together to maintain balance while making adjustments. The cobra pose gives you the stability to make these fine adjustments.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h2>Cobra Pose vs Other Stances</h2>
    <p>Understanding when to use the cobra pose versus other stances is crucial for effective longboard riding.</p>
    
    <div class="stance-comparison">
      <div class="stance-card">
        <h3>Upright Stance</h3>
        <p>Good for: Straight-line riding, maintaining speed</p>
        <p>Not ideal for: Sharp turns, preventing pearling, fine control</p>

      </div>
      
      <div class="stance-card">
        <h3>Transitional Stance</h3>

  <section class="common-mistakes">
    <h2>Common Mistakes with the Cobra Pose</h2>
    <p>Learning the cobra pose takes practice, and there are several common mistakes that can hinder your progress.</p>
    
    <div class="mistakes-list">
      <div class="mistake-item">
        <h3>Not Getting Low Enough</h3>
        <p>Many surfers don't get low enough in the cobra pose. You need to be significantly lower than your normal riding stance to get the full benefits.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="mistake-item">
        <h3>Leaning Too Far Forward</h3>
        <p>Don't lean too far forward in the cobra pose. This can cause pearling. Keep your weight centered and your chest up.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="mistake-item">
        <h3>Not Using Rail Control</h3>
        <p>The cobra pose is most effective when combined with rail grabbing. Don't just get low—use your hands to control the board.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="mistake-item">
        <h3>Staying in Cobra Too Long</h3>
        <p>Don't stay in the cobra pose for the entire ride. Use it when you need control, then transition to other stances as needed.</p>
