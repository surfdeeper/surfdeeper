      <p>The ocean is never still. Each wave carries energy, form, and motion — a dynamic expression of nature’s rhythms. By understanding the different types of waves, we not only navigate the sea more effectively, we also begin to see the ocean as a mirror of patterns in life and energy.</p>

      <h2>Spirals in Motion: The Connection of Nature</h2>
      <p>Before diving into wave types, note the striking similarity between ocean waves, hurricanes, and even galaxies. Spirals are nature’s way of channeling energy efficiently. Waves curl, roll, and crash along these spirals, revealing patterns that are physical, mathematical, and profoundly beautiful.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Rolling (Spilling) Waves</h2>
      <p><strong>Description:</strong> Gentle waves that slowly spill forward as the crest collapses.</p>
      <p><strong>Characteristics:</strong> Smooth, foamy, and predictable.</p>
      <p><strong>Visual cue:</strong> White water gently tumbling down the front of the wave.</p>
      <p>Perfect for beginners and for understanding the gradual release of energy in the ocean. Rolling waves remind us that not all power arrives in a rush — some flows with patient persistence.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Plunging Waves</h2>
      <p><strong>Description:</strong> Waves that curl sharply, creating a “tube” before crashing.</p>
      <p><strong>Characteristics:</strong> Intense, fast-moving, highly dynamic.</p>
      <p><strong>Visual cue:</strong> A hollow curl, often sought after by advanced surfers.</p>
      <p>Plunging waves concentrate energy and make the ocean’s force visible — where energy, form, and speed converge to create something both dangerous and beautiful.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Collapsing Waves</h2>
      <p><strong>Description:</strong> Waves that lose their shape abruptly, collapsing without much forward travel.</p>
      <p><strong>Characteristics:</strong> Sudden, chaotic, and less predictable.</p>
      <p><strong>Visual cue:</strong> A chaotic splash rather than a graceful curl.</p>
      <p>Collapsing waves remind us of the ocean’s volatility. Sometimes energy doesn’t move forward elegantly — it falls apart, dissipates, or surprises us with its force.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Surging Waves</h2>
      <p><strong>Description:</strong> Waves that don’t break traditionally but surge up the shore with strong momentum.</p>
      <p><strong>Characteristics:</strong> Fast, shallow, and powerful.</p>
      <p><strong>Visual cue:</strong> A wall of water pushing directly onto the beach.</p>
      <p>Surging waves teach persistence. Even without dramatic curls, energy can be unstoppable, reshaping the shore with relentless pressure.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Seeing Waves Beyond the Ocean</h2>
      <p>Understanding wave types is more than a practical skill — it’s an invitation to perceive energy, flow, and form. The ocean’s patterns echo in hurricanes, galaxies, and even the movements of people and systems. By observing waves, we attune ourselves to rhythm, change, and the underlying beauty of motion.</p>

      <h2>Bringing Waves to Life</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Animated diagrams showing crest and trough for each wave type</li>
        <li>Short video clips or GIFs of rolling, plunging, and surging waves</li>
        <li>Interactive hover elements to reveal the physics and dynamics</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Next Steps</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Spot these wave types at your local beach or in surf videos.</li>
        <li>Reflect on patterns: how does energy move in your life like these waves?</li>
        <li>Explore spirals and energy flows — from hurricanes to galaxies to the ocean.</li>
