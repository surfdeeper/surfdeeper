  <section class="cutback-philosophy">
    <h2>Why Cutbacks Matter</h2>
    <p>Cutbacks aren't just a maneuverâ€”they're a survival skill. When you feel yourself getting too far ahead of the wave, a well-timed cutback can bring you back to the power source. It's the difference between riding the wave and being left behind in the flats.</p>
    
    <p>The cutback is your reset button. It gives you another chance to find the pocket, to reconnect with the wave's energy. Without it, you're at the mercy of the wave's shape. With it, you're an active participant in the ride.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="reading-the-cue">
    <h2>Reading the Cue</h2>
    <p>Timing is everything with cutbacks. Start too early, and you'll lose the wave's energy. Start too late, and you'll be in the flats with nothing to work with. The key is reading the wave's cues.</p>
    
    <p>Listen to the wave. When you're in the pocket, you'll hear the wave building behind you. When you're too far ahead, the sound changesâ€”you'll hear the wave breaking in front of you instead of behind you. That's your cue.</p>
    
    <p>Feel the board. In the pocket, you'll feel the acceleration, the pull of the wave's energy. When you're too far ahead, the board will feel flat, lifeless. That's your cue too.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="execution">
    <h2>Executing the Cutback</h2>
    <p>Start your cutback while you still have the wave's energy. Don't wait until you're in the flatsâ€”begin the turn while you still have power to work with. Look back at the breaking section, not down the line. Your board will follow your eyes.</p>
    
    <p>Use your back foot to pivot. This isn't just a turnâ€”it's a pivot. You're changing direction, not just going around a corner. The back foot is your steering wheel, and the front foot is your accelerator.</p>
    
    <p>Keep your weight centered. Don't lean too far forward or back. You want to be balanced, ready to respond to the wave's changes. The cutback is about flow, not force.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="after-the-cutback">
    <h2>After the Cutback</h2>
    <p>Don't just ride straight after your cutback. Look for the next steep section. The wave is constantly changing, and the pocket is moving. Stay active, stay engaged, and keep reading the wave ahead of you.</p>
    
    <p>Use the momentum from your cutback to find the next section. You've just changed directionâ€”now use that energy to get back to the power source. Look for the steepest part of the wave, the section that's building, not breaking.</p>
    
    <p>Stay connected to the wave. The cutback is just one move in a continuous dance. Don't get so focused on the cutback that you forget about the wave. Keep reading, keep feeling, keep flowing.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="common-pitfalls">
    <h2>What Most Surfers Get Wrong</h2>
    <p>The biggest mistake is waiting too long. Don't wait until you're in the flats to start your cutback. Begin the turn while you still have the wave's energy. If you wait too long, you'll have nothing to work with.</p>
    
    <p>Another common error is looking down the line. You want to look back at the breaking section, not forward. Your board will follow your eyes, and if you're looking down the line, you'll end up there instead of back in the pocket.</p>
    
    <p>Finally, don't rush the cutback. This isn't a raceâ€”it's a dance. Take your time, feel the wave, and let the turn flow naturally. The wave will tell you when it's time to go.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="practice-methodology">
    <h2>Developing Your Cutbacks</h2>
    <p>Start with small waves. They're more forgiving, and you can focus on the technique without worrying about getting pounded. Practice the timing, the body position, the flow.</p>
    
    <p>Work on your wave reading. The cutback is only as good as your ability to read the wave. Practice staying in the pocket, feeling the wave's energy, and recognizing when you're getting too far ahead.</p>
    
    <p>Watch other surfers. See how they time their cutbacks, how they position themselves, how they flow with the wave. Every surfer has their own style, but the principles of timing and positioning are universal.</p>
