# Angling Down the Line

## The Philosophy of Angling
Angling down the line isn’t just going sideways — it’s reading the wave’s energy and positioning to harness it. A straight drop-in fights the wave’s flow; angling works with it for more control, style, and power.

## The Angling Spectrum
- 100% drop + 100% bottom turn: classic drop then hard bottom turn; powerful but energy-heavy
- 50% angling + 50% bottom turn: balanced, fits most conditions
- 100% angling + 0% bottom turn: pure directional riding from takeoff; most efficient and stylish

## Longboard Technique: Push/Pull Method
### 1) The Setup
- Slightly forward on the board as the wave approaches
- Weight centered and ready to shift
- Look down the line where you want to go

### 2) The Push/Pull
- To angle left: pull left hand, push right hand
- To angle right: pull right hand, push left hand
- Keep core engaged and shoulders square

### 3) Nose Control
- Use push/pull to direct the nose down the line
- Keep slight forward weight to maintain control
- Let board length work for you

## Longboard Control: The Cobra Pose
The [cobra pose](/guides/cobra-pose) adds fine control and prevents pearling while maintaining angle. Use it to:
- Prevent pearling by keeping weight centered
- Direct the board with precise rail pressure
- Maintain balance during direction changes

## Advanced Rail Grabbing Techniques
- Front-side rail grab: maximum control for bottom turns and cutbacks
- Back-side rail grab: maintain balance/control when back to the wave
- Dual rail control: two-hands for sharp changes and stability

## Reading the Wave for Angling
- Look for the shoulder: the unbroken section offers best angles
- Read the wave’s energy: left or right, longest ride potential
- Timing: begin angling during takeoff, not after the drop

## Common Mistakes
- Over-angling early: start with small angles and build up
- Looking straight down: eyes guide the board — look down the line
- Fighting the wave: work with the wave’s direction
- Poor weight distribution: stay centered and ready to shift

## Practice Drills
- Basic angle reps: 10°, 20°, 30° on small waves; feel differences
- Rail control: practice grabbing rails riding straight before angling
- Spectrum practice: try straight drop → 50% angle → 100% angle

## Pro Tips
- Start small before bigger waves
- Read and follow the wave’s natural direction
- Use your hands — primary control for angling
- Practice the spectrum and master rail grabbing

_Angling is about working with the wave’s energy, not against it._
