      <p>Before diving into wave types, note the striking similarity between ocean waves, hurricanes, and even galaxies. Spirals are nature’s way of channeling energy efficiently. Waves curl, roll, and crash along these spirals, revealing patterns that are physical, mathematical, and profoundly beautiful.</p>
      <p>“Total Immersion” (TI) is a philosophy of movement that applies these ideas to swimming. By focusing on balance, streamlining, and relaxed power, you reduce drag and move with the water rather than against it. For surfers, this translates to calmer paddling, better endurance, and clearer timing in chaotic conditions.</p>

    <section id="spiral-connection">
      <h2>Spirals Everywhere</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Ocean waves roll and pitch along curved paths, conserving and transforming energy.</li>
        <li>Hurricanes spin as self-organizing systems, channeling pressure and heat into motion.</li>
        <li>Galaxies arc into logarithmic spirals, distributing matter along elegant curves.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These aren’t coincidences — they’re expressions of how energy organizes when flowing through space. When you align your body with flow, you waste less effort and go farther with less.</p>

    <section id="principles">
      <h2>Core Principles (Applied to Surfing)</h2>
      <h3>1) Balance</h3>
      <p>Float your head and chest; let the hips rise. On a surfboard, this feels like a long, quiet body line with the sternum lightly raised — not pressing the board nose down. Balanced bodies waste less energy correcting wobbles.</p>
      <h3>2) Streamline</h3>
      <p>Lengthen through the crown of the head; keep the lead arm forward just long enough to shape a narrow profile. In paddling, avoid splaying elbows or flaring knees that create drag.</p>
      <h3>3) Relaxed Power</h3>
      <p>Apply force only where it counts: a high-elbow catch that presses water back, not down; a quiet recovery; a steady rhythm. Relaxation lets timing improve, which is more important than brute strength in surf.</p>

    <section id="practice">
      <h2>Simple Drills You Can Use Today</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Superman Glide:</strong> Push off lightly with one arm forward; feel head-spine-hips align. Translate to paddling by keeping the head neutral and hips high.</li>
        <li><strong>Balance Kicks:</strong> On your side with a light flutter, one arm extended. Breathe by rolling the whole body, not craning the neck.</li>
        <li><strong>Spearing Entry:</strong> Enter fingers first, wrist-elbow following a narrow slot. Quiet entries reduce splash and conserve momentum.</li>
        <li><strong>High-Elbow Catch:</strong> Set the forearm vertical early and press water back. On a board, this becomes a deeper, more anchored pull that moves you forward, not up and down.</li>
      </ul>

    <section id="for-surfers">
      <h2>Why It Matters for Surfers</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Lower heart rate while paddling; save sprints for takeoff moments.</li>
        <li>Less shoulder fatigue from cleaner mechanics and reduced drag.</li>
        <li>Better timing and positioning due to calmer breath and clearer rhythm.</li>
        <li>Improved decision-making when sets arrive — less panic, more presence.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Next Steps</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Practice one drill per session; keep it easy and curious.</li>
        <li>Film a 10–15 second clip of your paddle to observe drag and rhythm.</li>
        <li>Notice spirals in clouds, currents, and kelp; let them cue relaxation.</li>
