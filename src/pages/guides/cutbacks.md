# Cutbacks

## Why Cutbacks Matter
Cutbacks are pocket management. When you’re getting too far ahead, a timely cutback brings you back to the power source so you stay connected to the wave.

## Reading the Cue
- Timing is everything; start too early = lose energy; too late = flats
- Listen to the wave: sound and feel shift when you leave the pocket
- Feel the board: acceleration in the pocket vs. flat feeling out front

## Executing the Cutback
- Begin while you still have energy from the pocket
- Look back at the breaking section — your board follows your eyes
- Pivot from the back foot; front foot modulates drive
- Keep weight centered and ready to adjust

## After the Cutback
- Don’t ride straight; find the next steep section
- Use turn momentum to reconnect with the power source
- Stay active — the pocket is moving

## What Most Surfers Get Wrong
- Waiting too long and starting in the flats
- Looking down the line instead of back at the section
- Rushing the turn — let flow and timing guide you

## Developing Your Cutbacks
- Start on small waves to refine timing and flow
- Practice wave reading to stay in the pocket
- Watch experienced surfers for timing and positioning

## Pro Tips
- Start early while you still have energy
- Look back at the breaking section
- Stay centered and feel the wave’s pull
- Manage position within the wave, not just maneuvers

_Cutbacks are about connection, not control._
