# The Pop-Up

## Overview
The pop-up is the fundamental movement that gets you from lying on your board to standing up. It's the foundation of surfing and getting it right will improve everything else.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Starting Position
- Lie flat on your board with your chest up
- Hands positioned under your shoulders
- Feet together, toes pointed
- Look forward, not down

### 2. The Push-Up
- Push up with your hands while keeping your chest up
- Don't arch your back - keep your core engaged
- This creates space for your feet to come through

### 3. Bring Your Feet Up
- In one smooth motion, bring your back foot to where your knees were
- Then bring your front foot to the middle of the board
- Your back foot should be perpendicular to the stringer
- Your front foot should be at a 45-degree angle

### 4. Stand Up
- Push up with your back leg to get to your feet
- Keep your weight centered over the board
- Bend your knees slightly for balance
- Look where you want to go

## Common Mistakes

### The "Chicken Wing"
- **Problem**: Bringing your knees up first, then trying to get your feet under you
- **Fix**: Practice the motion on land - hands, then feet, then stand

### The "Belly Flop"
- **Problem**: Landing on your stomach instead of your feet
- **Fix**: Focus on bringing your feet to the right position before standing

### Looking Down
- **Problem**: Looking at your feet or the board
- **Fix**: Keep your head up and look forward

## Practice Drills

### On Land
1. **Pop-up Practice**: Do 20 pop-ups on your living room floor
2. **Balance Board**: Practice standing on a balance board
3. **Yoga**: Warrior poses help with the stance

### In the Water
1. **White Water Practice**: Start in the white water
2. **Timing**: Practice the timing without worrying about the wave
3. **Repetition**: Do it over and over until it's muscle memory

## Pro Tips
- **One Motion**: The pop-up should be one fluid movement
- **Don't Rush**: Take your time to get the technique right
- **Practice Daily**: Even 10 minutes a day will help
- **Film Yourself**: Record your pop-ups to see what you're doing wrong

## Equipment
- **Board Size**: Start with a longer, wider board for stability
- **Fins**: Larger fins help with stability
- **Wax**: Make sure your board is properly waxed

## When You're Ready
Once you can pop up consistently in white water, you're ready to try catching small waves. Remember - it's better to get the technique right on small waves than to struggle on bigger ones.
