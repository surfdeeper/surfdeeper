# The Cobra Pose

## Why the Cobra Pose Matters
Longboards need precise weight distribution. The cobra pose is your fine-tuning control: it helps prevent pearling while keeping speed and angle.

## Why Longboards Need Special Techniques
- More prone to [pearling](/guides/avoid-pearling)
- Slower response window — more time to adjust and to err
- Require deliberate weight distribution to maintain control

## Entering the Cobra Pose
### 1) The Setup
- Get low during takeoff
- Deep knee bend; chest up; core engaged
- Hands ready to grab rails

### 2) The Low Stance
- Get very low (knees ~90°)
- Weight centered over the board
- Low stance helps prevent pearling

### 3) Ready Position
- Hands ready for rail grabs
- Shoulders square; eyes down the line
- Stay balanced and responsive

## Rail Control in Cobra
- Front-side rail grab: control for bottom turns and holding angle
- Back-side rail grab: balance and control with back to the wave
- Dual rail control: two-hands for maximum control in critical sections

## Applying Pressure in Cobra
- Nose control via front hand and rail pressure
- Speed control via tail pressure with back hand
- Balance maintenance using both hands together

## Cobra vs Other Stances
- Upright: speed maintenance; less ideal for sharp turns/anti-pearling
- Cobra: sharp turns, anti-pearling, precise control, angling
- Transitional: move fluidly between stances as needed

## Common Mistakes
- Not getting low enough
- Leaning too far forward (invites pearling)
- Not using rail control
- Staying in cobra too long — transition when appropriate

## Practice Drills
- Basic cobra reps on small waves; focus on low stance and control
- Rail control drills while in cobra
- Transition drills: upright → cobra (turn) → upright
- Angling drill: use cobra while [angling down the line](/guides/angling-down-the-line)

## Pro Tips
- Get lower than you think
- Use your hands actively for rail control
- Stay centered and keep chest up
- Practice smooth transitions; use cobra when you feel pearling risk

_The cobra pose is your fine-tuning mechanism for longboard control._
