    <h2>The Philosophy of Angling</h2>
    <p>Angling down the line isn't just about going sideways—it's about reading the wave's energy and positioning yourself to harness its power. Unlike a straight drop-in that fights the wave's natural flow, angling works with the wave's energy, creating a more fluid and powerful ride.</p>
    
    <p>Think of it as the difference between dropping straight down a hill versus carving down it. The straight drop is fast but out of control. The angled approach gives you control, style, and the ability to read and respond to the wave's changing sections.</p>

  <section class="the-spectrum">
    <h2>The Angling Spectrum</h2>
    <p>Understanding angling means recognizing the full spectrum of wave riding approaches. At one extreme, you have the 100% straight drop-in with a 100% bottom turn—this is the classic "drop and turn" approach. At the other extreme, you have 100% angling with 0% bottom turn—this is pure directional riding.</p>
    
    <div class="spectrum-diagram">
      <div class="spectrum-item">
        <h3>100% Drop + 100% Bottom Turn</h3>
        <p>Classic approach: drop straight down, then turn hard at the bottom. Powerful but requires more energy and can be harder to control.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="spectrum-item">
        <h3>50% Angling + 50% Bottom Turn</h3>
        <p>Balanced approach: slight angle on the drop, moderate bottom turn. Good for most conditions and skill levels.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="spectrum-item">
        <h3>100% Angling + 0% Bottom Turn</h3>
        <p>Pure directional riding: angle from the start, flow with the wave's natural energy. Most efficient and stylish approach.</p>
      </div>

  <section class="longboard-technique">
    <h2>Longboard Technique: The Push/Pull Method</h2>
    <p>Longboards require a different approach to angling due to their length and stability. The key is using your hands to control the nose direction while maintaining balance.</p>
    
    <div class="technique-steps">
      <div class="step-card">
        <h3>1. The Setup</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Position yourself slightly forward on the board as the wave approaches</li>
          <li>Keep your weight centered but ready to shift</li>
          <li>Look down the line where you want to go, not straight down</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      
      <div class="step-card">
        <h3>2. The Push/Pull Technique</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>To angle left:</strong> Pull with your left hand while pushing with your right hand</li>
          <li><strong>To angle right:</strong> Pull with your right hand while pushing with your left hand</li>
          <li>Think of it like steering a car—one hand pulls, the other pushes</li>
          <li>Keep your core engaged and your shoulders square to the wave</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      
      <div class="step-card">
        <h3>3. Nose Control</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Use the push/pull to direct the nose of your board</li>
          <li>The nose should point down the line, not straight down</li>
          <li>Keep your weight slightly forward to maintain control</li>
          <li>Let the board's length work for you—it will naturally follow the angle</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>
  </section>

  <section class="cobra-pose-reference">
    <h2>Longboard Control: The Cobra Pose</h2>
    <p>For longboards, the <a href="/guides/cobra-pose">cobra pose</a> is essential for angling. This low stance gives you the fine-tuned control needed to prevent pearling while maintaining your angle. The cobra pose is particularly valuable on longboards where everything happens more slowly and the risk of pearling is higher.</p>
    
    <p>When angling on a longboard, use the cobra pose to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Prevent pearling by keeping weight centered</li>
      <li>Gain precise control over board direction</li>
      <li>Apply fine-tuned pressure to rails for steering</li>
      <li>Maintain balance during sharp direction changes</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="advanced-rail-grabbing">
    <h2>Advanced Rail Grabbing Techniques</h2>
    <p>Rail grabbing isn't just for angling—it's a fundamental skill for advanced wave riding. It gives you direct control over your board's direction and allows for more radical maneuvers.</p>
    
    <div class="advanced-techniques">
      <div class="technique-card">
        <h3>Front-Side Rail Grab</h3>
        <p>When riding front-side (facing the wave), grab the rail closest to the wave face. This gives you maximum control for bottom turns and cutbacks.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="technique-card">
        <h3>Back-Side Rail Grab</h3>
        <p>When riding back-side (back to the wave), grab the rail away from the wave. This helps maintain balance and control during back-side maneuvers.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="technique-card">
        <h3>Dual Rail Control</h3>
        <p>For maximum control, use both hands on the rails. This is especially effective for sharp direction changes and maintaining balance in critical sections.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </section>

  <section class="reading-the-wave-for-angling">
    <h2>Reading the Wave for Angling</h2>
    <p>Successful angling starts with reading the wave correctly. You need to identify the wave's natural flow and position yourself to work with it, not against it.</p>
    
    <div class="reading-tips">
      <div class="tip-card">
        <h3>Look for the Shoulder</h3>
        <p>The shoulder is the unbroken part of the wave that offers the best angling opportunities. It's usually less steep and more forgiving than the peak.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="tip-card">
        <h3>Read the Wave's Energy</h3>
        <p>Watch how the wave is breaking. Is it breaking left or right? Which direction offers the longest ride? Position yourself accordingly.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="tip-card">
        <h3>Timing is Everything</h3>
        <p>Start your angle as soon as you feel the wave's energy. Don't wait until you're already dropping—begin the angle during your takeoff.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </section>

  <section class="common-mistakes">
    <h2>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>
    <p>Angling can feel unnatural at first, especially if you're used to straight drop-ins. Here are the most common mistakes and how to avoid them.</p>
    
    <div class="mistakes-list">
      <div class="mistake-item">
        <h3>Over-Angling</h3>
        <p>Don't try to angle too sharply on your first attempts. Start with a slight angle and gradually increase it as you get more comfortable.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="mistake-item">
        <h3>Looking Straight Down</h3>
        <p>Your eyes should be looking down the line, not straight down the wave. Your board will follow your eyes.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="mistake-item">
        <h3>Fighting the Wave</h3>
        <p>Work with the wave's natural energy, not against it. If the wave wants to go left, don't force it right.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="mistake-item">
        <h3>Poor Weight Distribution</h3>
        <p>Keep your weight centered and ready to shift. Don't lean too far forward or back during the angle.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

  <section class="practice-drills">
    <h2>Practice Drills</h2>
    <p>Developing your angling skills takes practice. Here are some drills to help you progress from basic angling to advanced techniques.</p>
    
    <div class="drills-list">
      <div class="drill-card">
        <h3>Basic Angling Drill</h3>
        <p>Start with small waves and practice angling at different degrees. Try 10-degree angles, then 20-degree, then 30-degree. Feel how each angle affects your ride.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="drill-card">
        <h3>Rail Control Drill</h3>
        <p>Practice grabbing the rails while riding straight. Get comfortable with the feel of rail control before trying to angle.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="drill-card">
        <h3>Spectrum Practice</h3>
        <p>Try the full spectrum of approaches on the same wave. Start with a straight drop, then try 50% angling, then 100% angling. Feel the differences.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
