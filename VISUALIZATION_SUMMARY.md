# Surf Condition Visualization - Implementation Summary

## Overview

Added comprehensive data visualization for wind speeds and swell periods throughout the site, with a single source of truth for all condition ratings and color coding.

## What Was Added

### 1. Core Visualization Utility (`src/utils/condition-viz.ts`)

A new utility module that provides:

- **Wind Speed Ratings**: 
  - Calculates percentage (0-100%) where 35 mph = 100% (maxed out/dangerous)
  - Color codes: Green (ideal) → Light green (good) → Yellow (rough) → Red (dangerous)
  - Emoji indicators for quick visual recognition
  - Text labels: Ideal, Good, Rough, Maxed

- **Swell Period Ratings**:
  - Quality ratings from "Terrible" (< 6s) to "Epic" (20s+)
  - Color codes from dark red (terrible) through green (excellent) to blue (epic)
  - Emoji faces reflecting quality
  - Based on real surf science: longer periods = cleaner, more powerful waves

- **Formatting Functions**:
  - `formatSpotForMarquee()`: Complete spot condition formatting with HTML
  - `formatWindForMarquee()`: Wind display with color and emoji
  - `formatSwellPeriodForMarquee()`: Period display with color and emoji
  - `createWindProgressBar()`: HTML progress bar for wind percentage
  - `createSwellPeriodIndicator()`: Colored dot indicator

### 2. Homepage Marquee Enhancement (`src/pages/index.astro`)

Updated the surf ticker to include:

- Color-coded swell periods (e.g., "14s 🙂" in green)
- Color-coded wind speeds with emojis (e.g., "12mph 👍" in light green)
- Consistent formatting across all spots
- Uses `formatSpotForMarquee()` from the visualization utility

**Example Output:**
```
Ocean Beach: 4.2ft @ 14s 🙂 W • Wind 12mph 👍 NW
```

### 3. Spot Page Enhancement (`src/pages/maps/[...slug].astro`)

Added visual indicators to the "Current Conditions" section:

- **Wind Display**:
  - Progress bar showing percentage of max safe speed
  - Color-coded bar and text based on conditions
  - Percentage display (e.g., "Good (34%)")
  - Emoji and label

- **Swell Period Display**:
  - Color-coded period text
  - Emoji indicator
  - Direction label

### 4. Documentation

- `src/utils/CONDITION_VIZ_README.md`: Complete documentation of the visualization system
- Includes threshold explanations, API reference, and customization guide

## Technical Decisions

### Single Source of Truth

All condition rating logic is centralized in `condition-viz.ts`:
- Easy to update thresholds in one place
- Consistent ratings across entire site
- No duplication of logic
- Type-safe with TypeScript interfaces

### Color Palette

Colors chosen to match the site's existing theme:
- Primary green (`#00ff88`) for ideal/excellent conditions
- Gradient from green → yellow → red for degrading conditions
- Blue for exceptional groundswell

### Threshold Values

Based on practical surfing experience:

**Wind:**
- 0-8 mph: Ideal (offshore/glass conditions)
- 8-15 mph: Good (manageable for most surfers)
- 15-25 mph: Rough (challenging, experienced surfers only)
- 25-35 mph: Maxed (dangerous, should not surf)

**Swell Period:**
- < 6s: Wind chop, not worth it
- 6-9s: Weak swell, beginners only
- 9-12s: Decent, fun for most
- 12-16s: Good quality swell
- 16-20s: Excellent conditions
- 20s+: Epic groundswell, powerful waves

## Files Modified

1. ✅ `/src/utils/condition-viz.ts` - **NEW**: Core visualization module (233 lines)
2. ✅ `/src/pages/index.astro` - Updated marquee to use visualization helpers
3. ✅ `/src/pages/maps/[...slug].astro` - Added visual indicators to conditions display
4. ✅ `/src/utils/CONDITION_VIZ_README.md` - **NEW**: Documentation
5. ✅ `/VISUALIZATION_SUMMARY.md` - **NEW**: This file

## Build Status

✅ Build successful with no errors  
✅ No linting errors  
✅ TypeScript compilation successful  
✅ All pages generated correctly (64 pages)

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- Add wave height quality rating
- Historical condition trends
- Condition forecasts with visualizations
- Mobile-optimized visualization sizes
- Dark/light mode color adjustments
- Customizable thresholds per user skill level

## Testing

To verify the changes:

1. **Homepage**: Check the marquee ticker - should show color-coded periods and wind speeds
2. **Spot Pages**: Visit any spot (e.g., `/maps/ocean-beach`) - "Current Conditions" section should show:
   - Wind progress bar with percentage
   - Color-coded swell period with emoji
   - All colors matching condition quality

3. **Build**: Run `npm run build` - should complete without errors

4. **Dev**: Run `npm run dev` - test live updates of conditions
